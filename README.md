# The Atomizer
### A game about Particle Physics

Welcome to The Atomizer! This game is a scientific incremental game, starting with the smallest of the small to universe-spanning megastructures.

Currently, this game is in Alpha development, meaning that there will be frequent updates. This includes extra content, bugfixes, and surprise stuff :D However, you do not have to worry about your saves being wiped.

**WARNING: After a major version update, you may have to reset your game.**
